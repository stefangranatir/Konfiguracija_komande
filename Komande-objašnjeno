DHCP server

Manual configuration
To configure the DHCP server manually to respond to local requests you have to configure the following:

An IP pool for addresses to be given out, make sure that your gateway/DHCP server address is not part of the pool.
/ip pool add name=dhcp_pool0 ranges=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254

A network indicating subnets that DHCP-server will lease addresses from, among other information, like a gateway, DNS-server, NTP-server, DHCP options, etc.
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 dns-server=192.168.88.1 gateway=192.168.88.1

In our case, the device itself is serving as the gateway, so we'll add the address to the bridge interface:
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge1 network=192.168.88.0

And finally, add DHCP Server, here we will add the previously created address pool, and specify on which interface the DHCP server should work on
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool0 disabled=no interface=bridge1 name=dhcp1

DHCP kljent

/ip dhcp-client add interface=ether1 disabled=no

DNS server

  (r1)  dns server/ 2.1/24 
  / \
(r2)(r3)  2.3/24
2.2/24

r2 treba pingati r3

r1
ip ad ad ad=192.168.2.1/24 interface
